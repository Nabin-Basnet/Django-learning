# Django Project

## Introduction
Welcome to this Django project! This repository contains a web application built using the Django framework, which follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture. This project serves as a learning resource and provides a foundation for building scalable web applications.

## Features
- User authentication and authorization
- Database integration with Django ORM
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
- Template rendering using Django’s templating engine
- Static and media file handling
- Form handling and validation

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python** (>=3.8)
- **Django** (>=4.0)
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **Virtual Environment** (Recommended for dependency management)
- **Database** (SQLite by default, but you can use PostgreSQL/MySQL)

## Installation Guide
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local system:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
cd yourproject
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

On macOS/Linux:
```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows:
```sh
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Required Dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Database and Apply Migrations
```sh
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Create a Superuser (For Admin Access)
```sh
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Follow the prompts to set up the admin user.

### 6. Run the Development Server
```sh
python manage.py runserver
```
Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

## Running the Project in Production
When deploying the project to production, consider:
- Using **Gunicorn** or **uWSGI** as the application server
- Setting up **Nginx** or **Apache** as a reverse proxy
- Configuring **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** instead of SQLite
- Using **Docker** for containerization (optional)
- Setting `DEBUG = False` in `settings.py`

## Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file to manage sensitive data such as database credentials, secret keys, and API keys.
Example `.env` file:
```env
SECRET_KEY='your-secret-key'
DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL='postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname'
```

## Useful Django Commands

  ```sh
  python manage.py runserver
  ```
- Make migrations:
  ```sh
  python manage.py makemigrations
  ```
- Apply migrations:
  ```sh
